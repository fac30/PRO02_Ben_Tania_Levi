		// - This block handles the command cooldown logic.

        //  If the command's cooldown data does not exist in cooldowns, a new Collection is created for it.
        //  The current time is retrieved with Date.now().
        //  The cooldown amount is calculated from the command's cooldown property (in seconds) or a default duration of 3 seconds.
        //  If the user has already triggered the command recently, it calculates if the cooldown period has expired.
        //  If the cooldown is still active, a reply is sent to the user indicating how long they must wait before using the command again.
        //  If the cooldown has expired or does not exist, the userâ€™s timestamp is updated, and a timeout is set to remove their cooldown entry after the cooldown period.
